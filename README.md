# Whatsapp App

This project was build with React on the client side and Node.js on the server side.

## About the project

In this project, iv'e build an online chat between multiple users. users can login to the app, add new contacts and than talk with them. 

The connection was created using socket.io on the server side with a minimal server. 

All the data saves in the local storage to keep the data even if the browser in closed.

In this project i've used react hooks such as: useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useContext and a custom hook name: useLocalStorage.
